<p>Does this sound familiar to you? - You’re on your lunch break at work, you pickup your phone to find something and turn to Google. Maybe you’re looking for a new washing machine, a new sofa, or a weekend break in the Cotswolds…</p>
<p>This is the point where you begin to feel a headache coming on, many of the sites you visit look clunky and difficult to read on your phone, others take ages to load and don’t scroll properly - worse still, some of the functions don’t work at all and so you give up in frustration!</p>
<p>This is the experience of thousands of customers trying to find products, services and information that have a very poor user experience because the sites they visit have been built very poorly.</p>
<p>So how do you go about ensuring a first class web experience? - You develop a website that gives users exactly what they want, along with full functionality, whatever device they are on.</p>
<p>Indisputably, we all now live in the mobile age, and the chances are that the next person that searches for you and visits you site, will be doing so from a mobile phone. Indeed, countless millions of consumers use their smartphones and tablets to access the internet every day, and it's not difficult to see why - smartphones are just so convenient and easy to pick up and use, wherever you happen to be.</p>
<p>The first step you can take to make sure you stay ahead of your competition is to make your website mobile-friendly, and this may involve a complete overhaul. <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> is what you need, so let’s look at what that means and how it can help you and your business.</p>

<h3>For a smooth, rewarding mobile experience, you need <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>.</h3>
<p>As we’ve established, unintuitive navigation, fonts that don’t display correctly, missing calls to action, and seemingly endless page loading times can be incredibly frustrating when using your smartphone to browse the web. What’s the first thing you do when you get annoyed with a site?, you visit a competitor’s site instead! Now think about it, this could be happening on your site right now, you could have customers dropping-off and going elsewhere, all because the experience you provide isn’t up to scratch. </p>
<p>If you’re missing out on potential sales because of a poorly designed website then you need to take action. Whether we like it or not, the smartphone is now the browsing platform of choice and an increasing number of your customers will access your website from their phone - Smartphones and tablet users can no longer be given a second class experience.</p>
<p>The first step you can take to fix this issue, and one you can take right now - is to reach out to an experienced <strong>responsive web design company</strong> that’ll be able to create a 100% mobile-friendly website for you, thereby helping to keep your business one step ahead of the competition - And that’s Web Choice!</p>

<h3><strong>What is Responsive Web Design?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> might sound a bit like tech jargon to anyone outside the industry, so what exactly does it mean? - It refers to creating and developing a website in a way that provides a user with the best possible experience, no matter what device they use to access your site.</p>
<p>It means navigating, scrolling, loading and accessing information are all simple and quick. It means full-functionality - even on a mobile device.</p>
<p>To make sure your website is performing how it needs to on all devices, contact Web Choice today. Web Choice are an award-winning <strong>responsive web design company in London, UK</strong>. Responsive designs are able to instantly adapt to any device, no matter their size or performance capabilities.</p>
<p>The most successful companies in the UK today are investing in their website, ensuring that they offer a consistent experience for each and every customer and device.</p>
<h3><strong>Responsive web design can directly generate business's growth.</strong></h3>
<p>Images are a key factor with responsive web design. As our mobile devices become ever more capable, it’s harder and harder to get away with unattractive visuals. Today, high-density displays are commonplace, with many having a screen pixel ratio of 200 PPI or greater.</p>
<p>There are two technical considerations that must be made when integrating images using <strong>responsive web design</strong>; size and performance.</p>
<ol>
<li>With high-density mobile device displays, standard-sized images can sometimes look pixelated and blurry. A common method of preventing this issue is to double the dimensions of each image so that they look sharp on high-density devices, but the trouble is, this just creates a new problem...</li>
<li>With larger images comes longer loading times. Whilst this might not be such an issue for desktop users, anyone using a phone to access your site may not have the data to download large images (either due to their location or their data plan) and even if they do, they might be waiting a long time to do so… and this is where you can loose a potential customer to a competitor.</li>
<li>If web performance is a concern for you, Web Choice are ready to offer expert help and advice and get you back up to speed. As one of the very best <strong>responsive web design agencies in London U.K </strong>we have the experience, knowledge and ability that’s needed to overhaul your site and significantly boost performance. </li>
<li>If you aren’t sure if you need our help, or how your site currently measures up in terms of performance, Web Choice’s specialists can methodically audit your site for both speed and performance, giving you a detailed report on any areas that we think need addressing, along with making a case for any benefits such changes will bring to you and your business.</li>
<li>We don’t just do things for the sake of it, everything we do is motivated by delivering results. We won’t recommend that you make a change unless we genuinely believe that it’ll help drive sales and growth. We’ll work hard for you, we’ll work closely with you, and when we help you to succeed, we’ll celebrate right alongside you!</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Web Design & the power of Presentation</strong></h3>
<p>A website is a means of delivering an experience. We spend our day busy presenting ourselves in a very specific way, to a specific audience, and a website is no different - It needs to attract, engage and retain attention long enough to convince a potential customer that your product or service can answer their problem better, easier, and / or for less money than any of your competitors can.</p>
<p>Good web design is focused on delivering an excellent user experience. Web Choice offers a range of comprehensive web development services that all combine to present your brand in the most effective way possible.</p>
<h3><strong>Stop the Bounce & Boost Social Shares!</strong></h3>
<p>We are all aware of the significance of ranking highly in search engine results, but did you know that a fully responsive site will really help with your SEO strategies?</p>
<p>Google looks more favourably at responsive, fast-loading sites because they know those are the ones that’ll deliver a better experience to their customers.</p>
<p>A responsive site will really help boost your credibility in the eyes of the big search engines, thereby giving you greater visibility and a chance to drive even more new customers to your site.</p>
<p>Google measures the performance of sites with a metric referred to as the ‘bounce rate’. The bounce rate is measured as a percentage, and if you have a high bounce rate then it means that many of your potential customers are visiting your site, only to then leave quite soon after arriving. By having a beautiful, easy to use website that looks great on all devices, you’re helping to drive down your bounce rate and thereby score better in the eyes of the big search engines.</p>
<p>One further consideration is that of social media. If you make it easier for your customers to share your content with others, which responsive web design certainly does, then you stand a very good chance of reaching a wider audience.</p>

<h2 class="accordion-header">What exactly is a fully responsive website?</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>A responsive website is one that dynamically adjusts to a specific device, usually without the user knowing that it has done so, thereby providing the very best user experience in terms of design, usability, speed and content.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="accordion-header">What does the word 'responsive' mean in relation to web design?</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>The term 'responsiveness' is the ability to adapt to given input. In terms of web design, this means displaying a webpage on any device without compromising the way it looks - a responsive site is fast-loading and smooth to use, whatever the size of the screen being used to access it. With a responsive design your website has the flexibility to change layout, adapting to perfectly fit any given screen.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="accordion-header">How do I make my website fully responsive?</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>If possible it’s best to build a website from the ground up. To be responsive your website needs to have integrated browser and device detection, with a device capabilities database that can determine if specific HTML and / or CSS features are supported. Web Choice has a team of technical experts who know what it takes to create the very best websites that feature a responsive design. At every stage throughout design and development we test and evolve, creating bespoke designs that work perfectly on all devices with a specific focus on UI and UX design.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="accordion-header">Why is responsive web design so important?</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>Right now we are in the age of the mobile and the tablet. Far more users now choose to use their mobile devices to conduct Google searches for their content, products and services. It’s important to understand that any website that offers a poor browsing experience is looked at unfavourably by Google. Today, Google looks for responsive sites, ranking them higher as reward. Responsive web design gives you a considerable edge over your competitors so that you enjoy increased traffic and conversion rates. By offering a better experience, you can even draw potential new customers away from your competitors!</p>
</div>
<h2 class="accordion-header">The key benefits of responsive web design</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<ul>
<li>A premium user experience as well as full functionality. This can lead to increased site traffic and conversions</li>
<li>Higher Google rankings!</li>
<li>Mobile friendliness (more than half of all internet traffic is now comprisdown to mobile users!)</li>
<li>Improved search engine optimisation (SEO)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="accordion-header">What is the difference between responsive and adaptive web design?</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<h4>Responsive web design</h4>
<ul>
<li>A responsive design only has one iteration which seamlessly adjusts to fit a device's screen</li>
<li>The layout dynamically adapts to a browser window</li>
<li>Responsive web design relies on flexible, fluid grids</li>
</ul>
<h4>Adaptive web design</h4>
<ul>
<li>Features multiple fixed layouts that adjust to device-specific screen sizes</li>
<li>Has a layout that is resolved in the back-end, not by the user or their browser</li>
<li>Adaptive web design depends on predetermined screen sizes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="accordion-header">What is a responsive user interface?</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>A responsive user interface is a combination of technological and design principles that are combined to make a website function in such a way that it adjusts perfectly to any computer, mobile, tablet, or screen size. A responsive user interface is one that offers full functionality without compromise. Essentially it’ll appear as if that specific webpage was created for your exact device, whatever its resolution or aspect ratio.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="accordion-header">Examples of responsive web design</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
